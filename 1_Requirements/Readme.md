Good health has been a major concern since the inception of mankind whilst for some people attaining good health requires taking prescribed medicines or pills routinely. However, many patients find it very difficult to keep track of taking their medication in the right time and proportion. This happens especially if it involves taking pills or medication on daily basis due to several reasons such as heavy work load, forgetfulness, old age and alterations in day-to- day behavior can also have a significant result on whether patients recall to take their prescribed medications which can be termed as medicine adherence, which is a very serious problem because it may affect the total well-being of the patient, delaying the curing time, raising the total medical cost of the patient and can be a matter of life and death.
